## Notebooks order:
  1 - CSQRaim_SI.ipynb (https://github.com/bzaire/Reports/blob/master/CSQRaim_SI.ipynb)
  
     > Search for the chisq value to be aimed when fitting stokes I.
     
  2 - CSQRaim_SV.ipynb (https://github.com/bzaire/Reports/blob/master/CSQRaim_SV.ipynb)

     > Search for the chisq value to be aimed using stokes V individually.
     
  2 - S3d.ipynb (https://github.com/bzaire/Reports/blob/master/S3d.ipynb)
      
     > Computes the center of the paraboloid of spot coverage at both epochs (use only Stokes I but with all the sub-exposures).  
     
  2 - S3d_CHIPOT.ipynb (https://github.com/bzaire/Reports/blob/master/S3d_CHIPOT.ipynb)
      
     > same as above, but with chipot.   
 
  
  4 - SDR.ipynb (https://github.com/bzaire/Reports/blob/master/SDR.ipynb)
     
     > Fix everything else to find the differential rotation parameters (beta and gamma).
 
  5 - SDR_CHIPOT.ipynb (https://github.com/bzaire/Reports/blob/master/SDR_CHIPOT.ipynb)
