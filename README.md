# V471TAU

V471Tau is a eclipsing binary system member of the $625\mathrm{Myrs}$ old Hyades open cluster (Perryman et al. 1998). It is composed by a K dwarf MS star and a white dwarf.

The orbital motion of secondary star is given by:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:v_shift}
    V = K\sin\left[\frac{2\pi}{P_\mathrm{rot}}(t - t_o + \phi)\right] + v_\mathrm{rad},
\end{equation} where $K$ is the semi-amplitude, $P_\mathrm{rot}$ is the period of rotation around the primary star (the white dwarf), and $v_\mathrm{rad}$ is the radial velocity of the binary system. In this work we use the ephemeris by Vaccaro et al. (2015), $t_o(\mathrm{min} \; I) = \mathrm{HJED}\; 2445821.898291 + 0.5211833875\mathrm{E}$.

## Spectropolarimetric observations of V471Tau 

We used the ESPaDOnS instrument on the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) to observe the K-dwarf star. ESPaDOnS collect circularly polarized spectra (Stokes $V$) and intensity spectra (Stokes $I$) covering wavelengths from $370$ to $1,000\mathrm{nm}$ at a resolving power of $65,000$ (ref. --). Data spans in two different epochs: November 2004 (three nights) and December 2005 (four nights). They correspond respectively to a total of 58 and 102 circularly polarized spectra, each one acquired in $200\mathrm{s}$ of observation.
